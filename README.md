# Search Engine Using BST

Search engines have become an integral part of our lives living in this technological day and age. 
In this assignment I am implementing my very own search engine. My program is able to read a data from a file (Assignment_data.txt) and allow it to be searched. This is a console based application. 

The search engine is implemented using a Binary Search Tree. The basic idea here is to have each node store a keyword, along with associated list of URLs. The BST is implemented using a class, with left and right child pointers.
